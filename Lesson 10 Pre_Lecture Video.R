#What is a factor in R?

#A Factor in R is a variable used to categorize and store
#the data, having limited number of different values. It
#stores the data as a vector of integer values. Factor in
#R is also known as a categorical variable that stores
#both string and integer value data values as levels.

#Two main types of variables - categorical & continuous.

#Categorical variables have values that are limited and
#usually based on a finite group. Ex. Countries, year,
#gender, occupation, branch

#Continuous variable can take any value from integer to
#decimal. Ex temperature, stock price.

##Insert from video here

# Create gender vector


# Convert gender_vector to a factor

# Create Ordinal categorical vector 

# Convert `day_vector` to a factor with ordered level

# Print the new variable


# Count the number of occurrence of each level


#Continuous variables are the default value in R.
#Lets look at a built in dataset.




####VIDEO 2


# Create a, b, c, d variables


# Join the variables to create a data frame

# Order the data frame by price


#slice the dataframe

#save it to a new dataframe

#append a column

#creating a new vector


#Lists are the R objects which contain elements of different
#types like ??? numbers, strings, vectors and another list 
#inside it. A list can also contain a matrix or a function 
#as its elements. List is created using list() function.

#Create a List

#Name elements in a list

#Add an element

#Remove an element
